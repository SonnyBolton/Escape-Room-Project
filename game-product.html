    <p>Andrew played my escape room and let me record him to add his gameplay to my website to get someone elses POV of playing my game and trying it out overall it was fun to watch him play and have him embrace the feel i wanted for my game. I also made a gameplay video explaining why i did what i did and how it has an effect on the game and helps drive the whole feel and escape room of the game.</p>

    <p>Some of the models in this video was used in my game but some of them arent as i changed idea to a horror escape room due to lack of time and lots of bugs. These Models took around 2 hours to make all together but for the purpose of the speedrun i timelapsed the videos of the models i created inside of blender</p>

    <p>These blueprints showcase most of the code i used to create the puzzles and objects inside of my game including locked doors and some dressers aswell as a bed that triggers a jumpscare i have placed two beds in the game that haves multiple different jumpscares aswell as the couch it triggers a video i made where you watch a cube travel round a road and then triggers a jumpscare. I also showecased the code i used in my player character from movememnt too interactivity too adding footsteps audio.</p>
    <h2>Audio</h2>
   
    <iframe width="560" height="315"

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    <p>This is the audio that i used to create my game and give it the feels i wanted it to have from the footsteps to the opening and closing sounds aswell as the different jumpscare sounds they all add to the feel of the game and make the game sound and feel the way that it does and help give the fright of horror aswell as keep the feel of it being an escape room game and not just a plain horror game. </p>
    <p>I used a open door sound and a close door sound for opening and closing doors and storage areas from pixabay i also got all my jumpscare audio from pixabay aswell to help createthe affect of the game i wanted. </p>
    
    <h2>Webite Code Video</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mznAH4U0_qo?si=kVQke7gCXsSmak3T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>This video covers the code i wrote to make the website for the escape room project including all the html scripts and website layout. Including all the blueprint and video embed code that i had to add aswell so the website functions and has all the content it needs inside of it.</p>
    <h2>First Iteration</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/28ESaoYrQaY?si=4JcPoLBsnblGAJIz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>I choose to use a single floor two bedroom house design for a simple and easy to navigate experience for the players. Each Room has there own puzzle which all leads to the main puzzle the player has to complete to be able to escape and complete the game. </p>
    <h2>Second Iteration</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuMZ2hnrB5I?si=xJwHdCb-24OIaX7N" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>In the second iteration. I added props into the game to create the feeling of being in a house. From props like kitchen ovens to beds in the bedroom aswell as all the hidden puzzles that the player has to complete to be able to escape and complete the escape room.</p>
