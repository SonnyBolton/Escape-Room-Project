            <h2>Audio Aspects of my Escape Room</h2>
            <p>The audio style I'm going to use for my game is not much but the way I'm going to use them will help create the style of how the game is indented to feel, for example having a typing sound for when you press a button. Also, there will be some narrative sounds like the typing sound but not the same as receiving a message to you from someone else. As well as the background audio I'm going to be using will add to the feeling of being trapped and under pressure by hearing whisper's distant screams, this will add to the feel of my game. </p>

            <p>Narrative: Harrison: Helps drive the story forward </p>
            <p>Breathing sound: Pixabay: Adds sounds of the player and other people breathing </p>
            <p>Whispers: Pixabay: Adds more narrative to the story and helps drive the player  </p>
            <p>Struggling sounds: Pixabay: Death sound when someone gets killed</p>
            <p>Success Sound: pixabay: If completed a puzzle to give the player a feel of success </p>
            <p>Fail Sound: pixabay: If the player has failed and is getting closer to failing </p>
            <h2>Visual/Level Design Aspects of my Escape Room</h2>
            <p>The visual design is very basic but helps with also creating the feel of the game for example the old pc Infront of the player where the player must look for the narrative and the keyboard next to it for the player to use to type on as well as the family having TVs on their heads and being nailed to the chairs to show where the answer you type will be as well as a way to show being under pressure to save your family.</p>

            <p>Round table : Blender: Where the pc will be placed on, and the family be round </p>
            <p>Chairs  : Blender: For the player and his family to be stuck on  </p>
            <p>Old pc : Blender: Shows where the narrative is and player interactive </p>
            <p>Dark Room with 1 light : UE5: The room and scene the player will be in   </p>
            <h2>Interactivity Aspects of my Escape Room</h2>
            <p>The interactivity in my game apart from the menus Aswell as the gameplay is just the player typing letters to guess answers in hangman or scrabble Aswell as if they fail a question, they must choose who dies or by completing the game they can choose to save themselves or their family. he interactivity in my game apart from the menus Aswell as the gameplay is just the player typing letters to guess answers in hangman or scrabble Aswell as if they fail a question, they must choose who dies or by completing the game they can choose to save themselves or their family.  

The typing interactive is just the player pressing letters on their keyboard and it will input the letter they pressed to count as a guess. Aswell as when you get to pick whether you save yourself or your family you will have to either press yes or no with your mouse.</p>
