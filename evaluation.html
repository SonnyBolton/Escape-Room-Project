            <h2>Research Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The Research that i did investigated into the visual, audio and interactivity of escape room games or movies, focusing on how it engages the player or viewer, This research indicated that immersive audio, such as ambient sounds and music contributes to emotional engagement and focus. The visual element like lighting and props were found to be essential in creating a believable atmosphere. Additionally interactivity also played a lot into this holding a key role in keeping the player hooked an engaged into the game or movie from puzzles to object manipulation providing the player with a sense of accomplishment and progress whenever the complete a challenging puzzle or find a hidden object that that must collect. </p>
            <p>One of the strengths of the research that i helped me look deeper into how escape room games and movies are completed from looking into quantitative and qualitive research. This allowed me to fully understand what it takes to create a immersive escape room game. Even though my research was very limited to just 1 game and a small clip from a film i feel like it helped when it came to deciding on audio and visual aspects if i did more research into other games and movies it would of helped provide much more of a stronger understanding into how escape rooms work and how it is used to keep the viewer or player engaged.  </p>
            <h2>Planning Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The planning phase of the project was to plan how i was gonna create the game to keep players engaged and immersed into the game focusing on that small and easy to navigate 2 bedroom house. The goal was to ensure the player could experience a immersive and balanced game while still feeling engaged and that its not to easy or too difficult. The product integrated all the props and puzzles that i choose to use inside of my game The design kept the focus of making the game accessible and with intuitive interactions and clear puzzle progression. I felt that i did lack a little when it came to having the puzzles clear on what unlocks what making the player sometimes feel like they dont know where to go next. </p>
             <p>The planning shows my original idea that i had but during the process of creating this game i changed to a easy and smaller game idea so my planning doesnt represent the actually game i ended up with. The planning showed the immersive interaction i wanted the player to have and the puzzle i wanted to create to make a challenging game for the players to try and complete and traverse through.</p>
            <h2>Product Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The strengths of my planning helped me to include all aspects of the game into integration of audio, visuals and interactivity. However the product did lack the use of immersive audio and visuals. Also in the end i did change the game idea that i wanted to create shown in the game and product page originally i went with a hang man horror game but being complicated i could not figure out the main part of the game so i switched to a small basic house with easy to move around and interact with. This allowed me to clearly show how different my product is compared to my planning.</p>
            <p>My original product idea was to have a horror hang man game with complex puzzles for the player to complete and traverse through i got close to being able to create the main mechanic but it was super complex so eventually decided on switching to a much simpler game idea where the player is trapped inside a house and must complete puzzles to try and escape. Even though the game wasnt the same as the planning I still believe i made a decent game in the end and gave a few people a jump.</p>
